                <div id="textbox1">When I was 10 years old, my parents decided to move to New Zealand. The transition to a new country was a combination of excitement and challenge. We arrived on the 1st of January 2019 and immediately noticed the differences in the environment, culture, and temperature. New Zealand's climate was much hotter than what we were used to in South Africa. Also adapting to the New Zealand environment and feeling safe again took some time; this is because South Africa is known for being unsafe.</div>

                <div id="textbox2">I go to Botany Downs Secondary College and I'm currently in year 10. The teachers and the overall environment so different and supportive, which makes it a great place to learn. This school offers a wide range of subjects, and I'm really enjoying the 3 subjects that I've chosen for this year (DIT, DRT, BUP).</div>
